This will be my website stuff! :)   

Setting up Docker first for the website.
This will setup my environment for the website and to be able to use on any computer.
I will be using some Frontend skills and some Backend skills to make this website.
FRONTEND:
HTML, CSS, JS, React, Bootstrap, and Figma
BACKEND:
Node.js, MySQl, and DOCKER
Might use some other stuff but this is the main stuff I will be using.
MongoDB, JSON, and Python as well.

Docker is working now! :)
Next setup is the frontend stuff before I touch the backend. Since I need to focus on frontend this trimester.


# TODO
- Looking into Firebase for hosting and database.
- Looking into React for frontend.
- Look at different GUI for MySQL.
- See how I want my data to be displayed.

# DONE
-Wireframe for the website.
