This will be my website stuff! :)   

Setting up Docker first for the website.
This will setup my environment for the website and to be able to use on any computer.
I will be using some Frontend skills and some Backend skills to make this website.
FRONTEND:
HTML, CSS, JS, React, Bootstrap, and Figma
BACKEND:
Node.js, MySQl, and DOCKER
Might use some other stuff but this is the main stuff I will be using.
MongoDB, JSON, and Python as well.

Docker is working now! :)
Next setup is the frontend stuff before I touch the backend. Since I need to focus on frontend this trimester.


# TODO
- Looking into Firebase for hosting and database.
- Looking into React for frontend.
- Look at different GUI for MySQL.
- See how I want my data to be displayed.

# DONE
-Wireframe for the website.


# Backend questions to ask myself


My backend has a database

My backend has an API the frontend uses

I can also use postman, curl or wget to call my API

My API uses POST/PUT calls to update the database and GET calls to return data

I know SQL well enough to create my database, create the tables, insert the records, update or delete the records, add indexes and manage the data

I know what an ORM is and how to use at least one, with the pros and cons compared to using pain SQL

I can write reports against the data in my database

I can output different file types from my database (excel, word, html emails, text)

I understand authentication and security to some degree, including white hat hacking and things like sql injection, cross-site man in the middle attacks, phishing etc.

I understand encryption, basic PCI type requirements

I understand how to write and execute unit tests for my code

My source code is stored in version control (git)

I have a basic understanding of CICD pipelines

I have a basic understanding of containerization ( most likely docker)
